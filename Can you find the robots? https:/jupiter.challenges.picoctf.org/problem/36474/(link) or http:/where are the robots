This is a simple mapping challenge.

Linux users can simply use [$ dirb <website> ] to find if a list of webpages are present in having that domain name.
We have a lot of online tolls also for mapping a website.

I have used the dirb command and found that there was a webpage with name as /robots.txt
Once I opened the webpage I found there was an another link so I used it to navigate to the flag in plaintext.

Flag is 
picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_477ce}
