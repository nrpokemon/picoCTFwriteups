Files can always be changed in a secret way. Can you find the flag?

I got the image into my directory using wget. First thing I done on the file is finding whether it has any hidden data.

I used binwalk for this.

But I didn't get any hidden data except the JPEG file's data.

So I opened the file using a text editor.

I found interesting info at the top of the file. There were few base64 encoded lines:

One of the line was cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9

By decoding it I got the flag.

Flag: picoCTF{the_m3tadata_1s_modified}
